# Food-ordering-for-animal-shelter
Food ordering for animal shelter on monthly orders.

Animal shelter food ordering system is based on the following assumptions:-

    1.	Considered only positive values, for number of dogs.
    
    2.	Integer value for number of dogs.
    
    3.	Considered 20% percent extra food for ordering.
    
    4.	Leftover food value can be float.
    
    5.	Test case runs with input values

Test cases covered are as below:-

    1.	Total number of dogs is less than or equal to 30
   	
    2.	Total number dog is equal to zero, msg no food order for this month
    	
    3.	When total number of dogs is more than 30, msg we can have that many dogs
   	
    4.	Check the left-over amount takes in decimal value.

Test scenarios not covered are: -

    1.	What to do with remain food when you do not have dogs at the shelter.
    
    2.	Handling special charters
    	
    3.	Handling null value
    
    4.	Using the input file for the future months.
